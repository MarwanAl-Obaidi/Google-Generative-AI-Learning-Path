### What are some of the challenges of using LLMs? Select three options.

- [X] They can be used to generate harmful content.
- [ ] After being developed, they only change when they are fed new data.
- [X] They can be biased.
- [X] They can be expensive to train.

### What are large language models (LLMs)?:

- [ ] Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as discrete numbers, classes, and probabilities. It does this by learning from existing data and then using that knowledge to generate new and unique outputs.
- [X] An LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate human-quality text. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can be used for many tasks, such as writing, translating, and coding.
- [ ] Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that only can create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video by learning from new data and then using that knowledge to predict a discrete, supervised learning output.
