# Introduction to Image Generation

### Which process involves a model learning to remove noise from images?

- [X] Reverse diffusion
- [ ] Forward diffusion
- [ ] GANs
- [ ] Sampling

### What is the process of forward diffusion?

- [ ] Start with a noisy image and remove noise randomly
- [X] Start with a clean image and add noise iteratively
- [ ] Start with a clean image and add noise randomly
- [ ] Start with a noisy image and remove noise iteratively

### What are some challenges of diffusion models?

- [X] All of the above
- [ ] They can be computationally expensive to train.
- [ ] They can generate images that are not realistic.
- [ ] They can be difficult to control.

### What is the goal of diffusion models?

- [ ] To encode images to a compressed size, then decode back to the original size
- [X] To learn the latent structure of a dataset by modeling the way in which data points diffuse through the latent space
- [ ] To generate images by treating an image as a sequence of vectors
- [ ] To pit two neural networks against each other

### What is the name of the model family that draws inspiration from physics and thermodynamics?

- [ ] Autoregressive models
- [X] Diffusion models
- [ ] Generative adversarial networks
- [ ] Variational autoencoders
